# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Animating the menu to swap between the different categories, with two arrows on each side to cycle them and a nav bar on the top to select a specific one. If never touched, the animation will just keep going, but once interacted with, it will pause.
- Once clicking the "book" button, being taken to another screen to confirm the booking was completed.
- little easter egg where clicking the glowing circle in the corner of the about section would make it travel to a different corner in an anti-clockwise pattern.
